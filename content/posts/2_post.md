#First Blog of my Website

Hey, I'm Lakshita Shetty, a sneakerhead who's been obsessed with kicks for over a decade. Welcome to my blog, where I'll share my thoughts on my favourite sneakers every other day. To kick things off, I'm diving into one of the most iconic releases of recent times—the Air Jordan 1 "Chicago: Lost and Found."

Air Jordan 1 Chicago: Lost and Found
The Air Jordan 1 is more than just a sneaker—it's a cultural icon. When it first debuted in 1985, the Air Jordan 1 wasn't expected to become the legend it is today. Sceptics questioned Nike's decision to sign a young, unproven Michael Jordan to a major sneaker deal. But Jordan's incredible rookie season, where he averaged 28.2 points per game, quickly turned the Air Jordan 1 into a must-have for NBA fans and sneaker enthusiasts alike.

One of the most iconic colourways of the Air Jordan 1 is the "Chicago." Its bold red, white, and black design paid tribute to Jordan's team, the Chicago Bulls, and became a symbol of his meteoric rise. Over the years, the "Chicago" colourway has remained one of the most sought-after sneakers in the world.

I grew up in Mumbai, where my interest in sneakers sparked about 10 years ago. The vibrant street culture and the growing influence of global trends fueled my passion. But when I moved to Los Angeles two years ago, that was when this passion truly blossomed. LA, with its deep-rooted sneaker culture and the ever-present influence of basketball, amplified my love for sneakers, particularly the Air Jordan 1.

I still remember receiving my first pair of AJ1s on my 23rd birthday. Opening that box and lacing them up for the first time was like stepping into a piece of history. That moment deepened my love for sneakers and connected me to the legacy of Michael Jordan.

In 2022, Nike released the Air Jordan 1 "Chicago: Lost and Found," a reimagined version of the classic that stands out for its unique design. This release wasn't just about bringing back a classic; it was about telling a story. The "Lost and Found" design imagines what it would be like to discover a pair of 1985 Air Jordan 1s hidden away in a dusty stockroom for decades.

The sneaker features cracked leather, aged midsoles, and a vintage-inspired mismatched box lid, all carefully crafted to evoke the feeling of finding a long-lost treasure. Even the packaging includes a vintage receipt, adding to the nostalgic experience.

The "Lost and Found" isn't just a sneaker—it's a time machine that transports you back to the 80s. It celebrates the history of the Air Jordan 1, connects us to the memories these shoes hold, and showcases innovative design that pays homage to the past. Whether you're a seasoned collector or new to the sneaker world, the "Lost and Found" offers a unique glimpse into the legacy of the Air Jordan 1, making it a must-have for any sneaker enthusiast.
