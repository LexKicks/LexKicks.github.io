**Hello! I’m Lakshita Shetty.**

I recently graduated from the University of Southern California with a Master of Science in Applied Data Science, and I'm now diving deep into the world of data science.

In my journey so far, every day, I tackle another piece of the puzzle of understanding the world through data.

This website is my journal, where I'll share daily insights, discoveries, and the occasional "aha" moment as I continuously hone my skills as a data scientist. While many posts will delve into my work in data, you'll also find plenty about my love for sneakers—another passion that fuels my curiosity and creativity. Each entry is candid and spontaneous, offering glimpses into my evolving thoughts and experiences.

Much like this majestic horse rocking its kicks.
